# This is the docker image used for development tasks.

# It will NOT reresolve all dependencies on every change (as opposed to Dockerfile)
# but it ultimately results in a larger docker image.
#
# It does also preresolve test libraries (as opposed to Dockerfile.development)
# but does not override the entry-point etc.
